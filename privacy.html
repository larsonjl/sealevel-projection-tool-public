            <h2 class="left">Cookies</h2>

            <p>
                We may use cookies on this site in order to customize this site
                for return visitors. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to
                any personally identifiable information on our site. You are not
                required to accept any cookies to use this site.
            </p>

            <h3 class="left">Google Analytics</h3>

            <p>
                We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information
                about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information
                such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit
                when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming
                to this site. We use the information we get from Google
                Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects
                only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this
                site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We
                do not combine the information collected through the use of
                Google Analytics with personally identifiable information.
                Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web
                browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit
                this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google.
                Google’s ability to use and share information collected by
                Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by
                the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.
                You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return
                visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser.
            </p>

            <h2 class="left">Security</h2>

            <p>
                We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit
                sensitive information via the website, your information is
                protected both online and offline.
            </p>

            <h2 class="left">Updates</h2>

            <p>
                Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time and all updates
                will be posted on this page.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you
                should contact us immediately via email. See the Contact page
                for more information.
