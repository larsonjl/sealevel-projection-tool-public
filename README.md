## About

A web front-end for comparing sea level projections developed at the University of Colorado by Jacob Larson and based off the CCAR Altimetry Explorer built by Michael Croteau.  

The Sea Level Projection Tool seeks to bridge the gap between the various scientific communities whose data and models are relevant for better constraining estimates of future sea level rise. The site also aims to benefit global coastal communities by providing an interactive interface to the most recent peer-reviewed sea level projections for their location.

This site uses the following toolboxes:
* [Mapbox GL](https://www.mapbox.com/) - display map styles and tilesets
* [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) - create data-driven graphs and visualizations
